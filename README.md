# Image Generation using DCGANs
 here we feed a random noise vector of the size same as the image(128,128,3) in the generator and some pokemon images in the discriminator.the generator and discriminator both are deep neural networks with some convolutional layers.we perform deconvolution in generator and convolution in discriminator.use use batch normalization in each step after convolution to increase its performance.the generator tries to create pokemon images and the discriminator compares it with original image and compute the loss and then backpropagate using gradient descent algorithm.
